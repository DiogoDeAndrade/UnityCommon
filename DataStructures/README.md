Here we have a lot of data structures (I'll fill them in as I need to document stuff)

# TODO

* Document all of these for future reference
* ModularScriptableObject
  * A class derived of ModularScriptableObject should be able to filter modules that can be added to it - For example, by adding a tag [AllowModule(typeof(BaseClass))]
  * There should also be possible to filter the parents in the same way
